        Chess music: Copy and paste in any chess notation (or use the default
        notation), and select different modes and rhythms to translate it into a
        melody. The counterpoint button creates a melody for each player's moves
        and plays them at the same time, whereas normal play just creates one
        long melody out of all the moves.{" "}
